## ü•á Gold Layer ‚Äì Business-Ready Analytical Views

The **Gold Layer** is the presentation and analytics layer of the data warehouse, delivering dimension and fact tables designed for direct business use and reporting. This layer consists of **SQL views** that implement all final business rules and modeling (Star Schema), sourcing data from the Silver layer.

### ‚ú® Core Capabilities

- ‚≠ê **Analytical Views (Star Schema):**
  - Creates the primary **fact** (`fact_sales`) and **dimension** (`dim_customers`, `dim_products`) views that form the backbone of BI analysis.
  - Each view transforms, combines, and enriches records from the Silver layer to deliver a **single source of truth** for reporting and dashboards.

- üåê **Usage:**
  - Gold layer views are meant to be queried directly for analytics, KPI calculations, BI dashboards, or ad-hoc business questions.
  - Separates all complex transformation and integration logic from the user‚Äîmaking downstream analysis fast, easy, and reliable.

- üîé **View Logic:**
  - Performs complex joins, calculated fields, and applies business rules needed for advanced reporting.
  - Ensures data consistency: all business logic is centralized, so every stakeholder works from the same clean, enriched dataset.

### üìÅ Objects in the Gold Layer (`4. gold/`)

- `ddl_gold.sql` ‚Äì Script to create Gold views for all fact/dimension tables.
- `fact_sales` ‚Äì Main transactional fact view for sales analysis.
- `dim_customers` ‚Äì Customer dimension view aggregating, integrating, and cleansing CRM and ERP customer information.
- `dim_products` ‚Äì Product dimension view built from integrated product/category/location data.

### üìù Script Formalization

**Script Purpose:**
- Establishes essential, reusable views for BI and analytics.
- Each view in the Gold layer:
  - Consumes and combines data from Silver-layer tables,
  - Applies all necessary data transformations, and
  - Presents ready-to-analyze datasets matching business requirements.

**Usage:**
- Run `ddl_gold.sql` to create/update all core analytical views.
- Query the views directly (e.g., `SELECT * FROM gold.fact_sales`) for insights, dashboard feeds, or advanced analytics.

> _‚ÄúThe Gold layer delivers performance, consistency, and trust. All BI, reporting, and analytics tools should consume data directly from these views for unified, business-validated insights.‚Äù_
